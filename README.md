# Fetal-Monitoring-System
The project involves developing a non-invasive fetal movement monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller, MPU6050 accelerometers, a Bluetooth module, and a TCA9548A I2C multiplexer. This innovative system is designed to enable pregnant mothers to monitor fetal movements at home, providing a low-cost and reliable solution.
